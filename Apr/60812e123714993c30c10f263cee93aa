SA halts shipping at key port of Durban after heaviest downpour in six decades The Port of Durban handles 60% of the country’s shipments and transporting of goods and commodities to and from nations in the region as far north as the Democratic Republic of Congo. After the catastrophic floods, South Africa will need R1.9 billion ($120 million) to complete disaster relief work, Zikalala said. Africa’s most developed economy allocated a billion rand to date for disaster funds, after declaring a national state of disaster earlier this week. Floods have killed 485 people, and left the province with significant infrastructure damage. The South African army has deployed 10000 troops to help with search and rescue efforts, delivery of food and water, and to help rebuild collapsed roads and bridges. Read:
