International protestant church and charitable organisation the Salvation Army on Friday condemned the brutal killing of a Zimbabwean man this week, as the country sees a flare up of anti-undocumented foreigner sentiments in Diepsloot, a township in the north of Johannesburg. The man identified as Elvis Nyathi was allegedly “tortured, beaten with hammers” and subsequently murdered by a mob on Wednesday, April 6. The attack comes after disgruntled residents of Diepsloot complained about high crime rates in the area, saying undocumented foreign nationals are responsible. The organisation frowned upon the lack of peace, goodwill and spirit of reconciliation in the province, especially post the turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic over the last two years. “There are many allegations of the involvement of foreigners as the root of problems of crime and unemployment. It is simply nonsensical to characterise the behaviours of communities by blaming foreigners,” leader of Salvation Army in Southern Africa, Torben Eliasen says in a statement. The organisation noted that the recent spate of events in Diepsloot contradict South Africa’s reconciliatory history and dishonour the role neighbouring countries played in supporting South Africans during the times of apartheid. “In the days of apartheid, many South Africans found refuge and nurturing as they fled the violence of the apartheid system. In neighbouring countries and others further afield, South Africans were warmly welcomed, in spite of being foreigners,” “The violent and coercive intimidation by some factions in the community is the antithesis of the principles of reconciliation laid down by Nelson Mandela as guiding lodestars for South Africa in 1994,” Eliasen says. “It is tragic that people are undoing these principles as they advance their own narrow political interests.” The Salvation Army called on those leading these acts of violence against foreign nationals to abandon their efforts.
