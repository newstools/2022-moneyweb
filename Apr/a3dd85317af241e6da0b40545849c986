Over the last month and a half, the three JSE-listed education stocks have reported their 2021 results (all have December year-ends, so the results are comparable). On February 23, private schooling group Curro (COH) reported revenue growth of 15% from 9% learner growth (and fee increases), good cash generation and a strong recovery in earnings after the prior period’s impairments. On March 14, tertiary collection Stadio (SDO) reported 9% student growth, revenue rising 18% and earnings up somewhat more. Finally, last week, diversified educational group AdvTech (ADH) reported 6% learner growth driving revenue growth of 8% (there were no fees increases in its schools segment) and earnings lifting 35%. How do these stocks compare? Zooming into key metrics – financial, operational and market valuation – we can see more clearly: * Using each company’s own ‘normalised’ version of earnings per share; ** Including IFRS 16 leases; *** Operating profit/net finance charges. A few observations from the above comparison of these stocks: All things considered, I would argue that Curro is currently the poorest of the JSE-listed investment options (fee-driven growth, high gearing, straining balance sheet and the most expensive share), while AdvTech and Stadio both appear better quality. Stadio, though, has a higher valuation than AdvTech, a more concentrated portfolio and a less tested growth profile. Thus, via process of elimination, I would have to say that the pick of the domestic education sector has to be AdvTech, with a balanced schooling and tertiary portfolio and top-, bottom- and volume-based growth trajectory.
