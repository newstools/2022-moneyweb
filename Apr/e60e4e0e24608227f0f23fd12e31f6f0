The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has concluded its Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation (LTO) review of the country’s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station. The evaluation was completed on March 31, 2022 and requested by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, for “aspects essential to the safe LTO of two units of Koeberg.” Koeberg, which is owned and operated by the country’s national electricity supplier Eskom, was provided with recommendations to enhance plans for its LTO. This included analysing the plant’s preparedness, organisation and programmes for secure performance. Among others, the team of international nuclear specialists suggested that Eskom critically analyse and implement all plant programmes for LTO, complete the verification of appropriate cables and ensure full functionality of the containment structure monitoring system. According to Gabor Petofi, leader and senior nuclear safety officer at IAEA, the plant “has made progress in ageing management activities and preparation for safe LTO”, since its first review mission in 2015. Petofi says that “despite challenges, the plant has eliminated several deviations in ageing management activities.” Koeberg was taken offline on January 18 for refueling and maintenance and is due to return to service in June. Its design life is due to end in 2024, but SA intends to extend its ‘lifespan’ by 20 years.
