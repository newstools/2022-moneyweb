Chinese technology stocks slumped for a second day amid continued concern about the risk of local firms getting kicked off American exchanges. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of the biggest Chinese firms in the sector, lost as much as 3.9% in early trading on Friday. It fell 1.4% on Thursday after the US securities regulator played down the prospect of an imminent deal to keep Chinese firms listed there.  Baidu Inc., which was added by the to the list of firms facing possible delisting, tumbled as much as 8.5% to be the biggest loser on the Hang Seng Tech gauge on Friday. Bilibili Inc. was also down over 8%. The two-day selloff shows that investors remain on edge amid a long-standing dispute over whether American regulators can get full access to US-traded Chinese company audits. In response to the SEC chair’s comments, China said talks with the US accounting watchdog will continue.
