JSE-listed construction retailer, Cashbuild, reported a 10% drop in revenue in its third fiscal quarter. Around a third of the decline was attributed to the looting of 36 stores during the unrest last year. Excluding the effects of the riots, revenue would have been down 7%.

We have been aiming for between level four and six.” Prowse says its steel products saw a 20% increase in price, which drastically reduced sales. Cashbuild introduced a national ecommerce offering last year, but its contribution to group sales was insignificant. Till transactions declined by 17%.  Sales at existing stores dropped by 19%, while new stores saw an increase of 2%. In the second quarter of last year, Cashbuild’s third fiscal quarter, sales rose by 21% due to people renovating their homes during the Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Cashbuild opened two new stores during the third quarter bringing the total number of stores to 317. Five of the looted stores are currently being rebuilt for reopening.
