Stage 2 load shedding amid a cold snap “Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented continuously from 05:00 on Wednesday to Friday at 05:00 due to further unit failures and continued delays to return units to service,” Eskom said in a statement. Necessary move It stressed that the move had “regrettably become necessary” “The extension of load shedding is caused by the failure of additional units and the continued shortage of generation capacity due to delays in returning to service three generating units at Camden Power Station and two generating units at Tutuka Power Station,” Eskom added. “Overnight a generation unit each at Medupi, Matla, Kendal and Komati power stations failed while 240MW of power imports from Mozambique was interrupted, exacerbating the supply constraints,” the utility said. Three generation units were returned to service at Matla, Grootvlei and Camden power stations. “We currently have 5 379MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 827MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns.” Read: Eskom to scale back on planned maintenance during the winter season “The extension of the load shedding is required to preserve the remaining emergency generation reserves in an attempt to limit the stage of load shedding. Eskom would like to inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity may require further load shedding. Eskom reiterated that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort in order to protect the national grid.
