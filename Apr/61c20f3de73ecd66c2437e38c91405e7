Records have been broken repeatedly in recent years for fancy colored diamonds, which are rarer than colorless ones. Colored diamonds come in many hues, but pink and blue are the most coveted. Blue diamonds are among the rarest and are found at levels four times deeper than most diamonds, according to the Gemological Institute of America. In 2016, Christie’s in Geneva sold the Oppenheimer Blue for CHF56.8 million ($59 million). Sotheby’s sold a blue diamond for more than $4 million a carat in Geneva in 2015.
