South Africa’s central bank said on Tuesday in a biannual review of its monetary policy stance that a continued economic recovery was threatened by inflation, as price pressures had risen markedly. The bank added that it expected monetary policy to remain accommodative and in a presentation accompanying the review described the policy trajectory as “threading the needle between support and inflation risk”. “Domestic inflation could surprise higher if the hostilities in Ukraine continue to intensify or if oil and gas supplies are additionally constrained,” the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) said. “The upward drift in inflation expectations and sharply higher producer prices further tilt the inflation risk to the upside.” The Sarb has raised its main lending rate at each of its last three monetary policy meetings by 25 basis points, taking it to 4.25%. At its meeting last month it cited inflation risks linked to the war in Ukraine and said inflation was forecast to breach its 3% to 6% target band in the second quarter. Annual consumer inflation stood at 5.7% in February, the latest month for which data are available. March figures are due next week.
