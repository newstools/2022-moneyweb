Interpol placed on its most-wanted list two brothers sought by the authorities in South Africa on charges of money laundering and fraud. Red notices have been obtained for Rajesh and Atul Gupta, Hermione Cronje, head of South Africa’s Investigating Directorate, said by phone on Monday. Interpol approved the notices last month and then took further steps to clear them, she said. “We received confirmation of them today,” Cronje said. South African authorities accuse the Guptas of being at the centre of a web of state corruption during former President Jacob Zuma’s rule during which the government estimates more than R500 billion was stolen from its coffers. The Gupta brothers deny any wrongdoing and have fought the application of the red notices, saying they’re victims of a political witch hunt in South Africa. A judicial panel that investigated the corruption is scheduled to release a third report this week on its findings after an almost four-year inquiry. Cronje handed in her resignation in December and Monday is her last day as head of the Investigating Directorate. © 2022 Bloomberg
