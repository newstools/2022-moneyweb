President Cyril Ramaphosa named Andrea Johnson as the new head of the National Prosecuting Authority’s Investigating Directorate that is spearheading efforts to prosecute those involved in state capture and graft. Johnson, a senior deputy director in the NPA with more than 25 years’ experience, including in district, regional and high court prosecutions replaces Hermione Cronje, who quit after less than three years in the post. Johnson who was part of the team that prosecuted Jackie Selebi, a former South African police chief and Interpol president for corruption in 2010, takes over March 1. The advocate’s appointment comes at an “important time in the country’s effort to act decisively against individuals involved in state capture and corruption,” Ramaphosa said in a statement. The NPA is playing a crucial role in ensuring that those accused of corruption in reports compiled by a four-year judicial inquiry into state capture are prosecuted. The commission probed graft involving the government during former President Jacob Zuma’s administration that the state estimates cost the country R500 billion. “Johnson will be expected to lead the Investigating Directorate into the next phase of its work as the people of South Africa look to the criminal justice system to bring those responsible for state capture and corruption to book,” the president said in his statement. As part of efforts to build the state’s capacity to fight crime and corruption the president also said he was appointing: In a separate statement, he named Thembisile Majola the new director-general of the State Security Agency from March 1 to “stabilise the country’s intelligence services.” Earlier this month Ramaphosa announced plans to overhaul law-enforcement agencies in the face of scathing criticism of its response to rampant crime and last year’s deadly riots that claimed 354 lives. © 2022 Bloomberg
