South African President Cyril Ramaphosa relaxed almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions as the number of new infections and related hospitalisations and deaths in the country continue to drop. Scientists estimate that 60% to 80% of the population have some form of immunity to Covid-19, either through vaccination or prior infection, making it possible to further open up the economy, Ramaphosa said Tuesday in a brief televised speech. “We feel the fear and despair of the last two years lifting from our shoulders,” he said. “We are now ready to enter a new phase in our management of the pandemic.” Among the restrictions being eased are: South Africa has had 3.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases so far. Almost 100 000 of those who were diagnosed with the disease have died, although excess deaths data show the true toll is probably about three times higher. About 48% of adults have had at least one vaccination. Ramaphosa said travelers entering South Africa will now be able to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test, easing passage for visitors and providing a boost to the tourism industry. All unvaccinated travelers entering the country will be offered a shot, he said. A state of disaster that was imposed in March 2020 after the onset of Covid-19 will be lifted as soon as new health rules are in place to manage the pandemic, Ramaphosa said.
