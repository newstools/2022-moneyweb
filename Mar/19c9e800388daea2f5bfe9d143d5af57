Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, rose back above $41 500 amid a sharp rally in digital tokens on Wednesday as the industry awaits further detail on a U.S. executive order. The coin advanced as much as 8.8% to $41,874 and was near that level as of 2:40 p.m. in Singapore. Ether gained as much as 6.7%, while Terra — another top 10 token — is up almost 20% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.  Investors are awaiting an update on a possible executive order from President Joe Biden this week, which is expected to outline the U.S. government’s strategy for cryptocurrencies. In a since-removed statement dated March 9 posted to the U.S. Department of the Treasury website, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the approach outlined in the order “will support responsible innovation that could result in substantial benefits for the nation, consumers, and businesses.” “For years, the crypto market has been hindered by a lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S.,” said Hayden Hughes, chief executive officer of trading social-media platform Alpha Impact, in a message Wednesday. “If clear guidelines are passed, this could be a watershed moment for the industry.” © 2022 Bloomberg
