SPAR Group distribution centres in Poland and Switzerland have removed all products manufactured and sourced from Russia and Belarus, the South African supermarket chain told Reuters on Thursday. “These products are few and not material in value. At this stage there has been no significant impact on the operations of the SPAR Switzerland and SPAR Poland businesses,” the retailer said in an emailed response to Reuters queries. SPAR added that it was working with SPAR International to assist with the supply of certain essential goods to SPAR Ukraine.
