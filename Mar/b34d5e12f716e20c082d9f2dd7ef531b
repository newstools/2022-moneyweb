Stock futures clung to small gains after two days of selling as traders assessed comments from Jerome Powell on the Federal Reserve’s policy intentions. Treasuries fell, while oil topped $110 a barrel. S&P 500 contracts pared their advance, while 10-year yields halted a four day slide. “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labour market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month,” Powell said Wednesday in remarks prepared for his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. in Washington. US companies in February added more jobs than forecast as Covid-19 cases dropped and restrictions eased, encouraging more Americans to work. The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 383,000 in February.

OPEC and its allies agreed another modest revival in supplies for April at a low-key meeting that was overshadowed by the market turmoil unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Sell-side analysts in the US are getting more nervous about earnings forecasts, with profit revisions turning most negative since May 2020. Downgrades are now outweighing upgrades as the war in Ukraine, rising oil prices and policy tightening may weigh on economic growth. What to watch this week: Some of the main moves in markets:
