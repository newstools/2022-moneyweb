Pfizer’s inoculation is being offered as a booster by the South African government. South Africa, which together with Botswana was the first country to announce the discovery of the Omicron variant in November, has seen coronavirus cases plunge. However, the country’s test positivity rate has stuck stubbornly above 5%, indicating that the virus is still circulating. Another wave of infections is expected in about May, according to Gray. On Sunday the country tallied 989 new infections with a test positivity rate of 5.9%. Sherpa, which is being run by Moderna and the SAMRC, is the second vaccine trial that Moderna will undertake in South Africa. The Ubuntu trial stretches across eight African nations and is designed to determine the vaccine’s efficacy in people infected with the HIV virus.
