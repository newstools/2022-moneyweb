An extended conflict between Russia and Ukraine would hit the US economy broadly, with all 50 states affected by the fallout, according to an analysis by Moody’s Analytics. While the US has limited trade ties with Russia and Ukraine, businesses from beer breweries in Missouri to semiconductor plants in California would see an impact, as prolonged combat and even harsher sanctions constrict supplies and drive up global prices for oil and other critical materials.  “The odds are much better than even that we actually do experience a recession in that scenario,” chief economist Mark Zandi said. Some states would fare better than others, according to the analysis of effects of a military conflict that extends into next year. Energy producers such as North Dakota and Alaska stand out in that regard, with a lengthy conflict boosting oil prices to $150 a barrel as Russia reduces energy supplies to Europe. On the flip side, Alabama and Mississippi — the two states most dependent on cars and driving — would suffer disproportionately from an energy shock. The analysis, by Moody’s Analytics senior regional economist Adam Kamins, shows that an extended war would hurt US states and localities in a variety of ways, some of them not immediately apparent. A Moody’s Analytics computer model suggests that the US as a whole would be able to avoid a recession, even if military hostilities are prolonged. But Zandi has his doubts. “Models are very good in typical times,” he said. In highly stressed and very unusual environments, “the world goes what I would call non-linear and things go off the rails.”
