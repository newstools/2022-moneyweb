Engineering and mining group Murray & Roberts reports that its subsidiary, Clough, is part of a consortium selected as the preferred tenderer to advance the R16.5 billion Inland Rail project in Australia. According to a Sens statement released on Tuesday, Clough forms part of the Regionerate Rail consortium, which comprises of the Plenary Group, GS Engineering and Construction, Webuild (formerly Salini Impregilo) and Service Stream. The consortium has been selected to develop the Gowrie-to-Kagaru section of the project. “This section of the Inland Rail project is in Queensland, with a contract value of more than AU$5 billion for the design and construct elements, of which approximately AU$1.5 billion is attributable to Clough,” the group said. The project, which was initiated to keep up with Australia’s increasing freight demands, commenced in 2018 and is headed for completion in 2027. The group says this section of the project comprises about 128km of new and upgraded rail track and includes a 6.2km tunnel, which will be the largest diameter freight tunnel in the southern hemisphere. “The Inland Rail project will transform how goods are moved around Australia and complete the backbone of Australia’s national freight network,” it added. Connecting Melbourne and Brisbane via regional Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the project is set to create opportunities for businesses, industries and regional communities. Moreover, shifting more goods from road to rail will mean safer, less congested roads and lower carbon emissions for Australia. Palesa Mofokeng is a Moneyweb intern.
