South Africans can expect loadshedding from Monday evening until Wednesday morning, due to “multiple generating unit failures over the past 24 hours”, according to Eskom. Stage 2 loadshedding is due to be implemented continuously starting at 17:00 on Monday until 05:00 on Wednesday. In a statement on Monday afternoon Eskom initially said power cuts would be implemented only overnight for two days, but it escalated the duration soon after, following Medupi Unit 3 apparently breaking down. “This adds to the multiple generating unit failures that occurred over the past 24 hours, and has severely reduced available generating capacity,” it explained in a second statement. Eskom said the power cuts are necessary to replenish its emergency generation reserves, which it has used “significantly” since the weekend. “Since this morning, a unit each at the Matla, Kendal, Matimba, Kusile and Grootvlei power stations tripped, while a unit each at Arnot and Hendrina power stations were forced shut down. This, in addition to other units that had tripped during the weekend, reduced available generation capacity, forcing Eskom to rely heavily on emergency generation reserves to keep the lights on,” it stated. “Total breakdowns amount to 15 228MW while planned maintenance is 6 307MW of capacity as we continue with the reliability maintenance.”
