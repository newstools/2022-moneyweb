Japan’s Nikkei index fell on Thursday and was on course for its sharpest quarterly drop in two years, as investors booked profits at the end of fiscal year. The Nikkei share average fell 0.18% to 27 977.98 by the midday break, after edging higher in early trade. The broader Topix slipped 0.22% to 1 965.20 in range-bound trading. For the quarter, the Nikkei is set to lose 2.8%, its biggest drop since the quarter ended March 2020. “Some investors sold stocks to lock in profits at the end of the fiscal year, while some bought back stocks as they wanted to boost shares that have resistance under inflation.” said Ikuo Mitsui, fund manager at Aizawa Securities. “But the market seems to be firm because despite sharp gains this month, I do not see an aggressive sell off for a profit taking.” But for the month, the Nikkei is set to post its biggest jump since November 2020, jumping 5.47%.
