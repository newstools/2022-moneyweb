South Africa has identified an imported case of Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic virus harboured by rats and transmitted to humans. The infection is the first to be detected in the country since 2007. The case was identified in a man in the southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal who had traveled to Nigeria, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said in a statement on Friday. The man has died, the NICD said. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and kills about 5 000 people a year.
