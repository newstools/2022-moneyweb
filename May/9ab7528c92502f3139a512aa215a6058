Mediclinic International is reinstating dividends after almost doubling full-year profit, it said on Wednesday. The London-listed company’s headline earnings per share for the year to March 31 rose to 19 pence from 9.6 pence a year earlier, driven mainly by increasing patient numbers as coronavirus restrictions eased. The company announced a dividend of 3 pence per share. Healthcare providers were hit hard in 2020 and partly in 2021 as the Covid-19 pandemic forced people to postpone non-essential hospital procedures. But as vaccination rates increased and successive waves of Covid-19 proved to be less deadly, people resumed hospital visits, helping to boost revenue and profit at private hospitals. Mediclinic, which owns a chain of private hospitals in southern Africa, the Middle East and Switzerland, posted annual revenue up 8% at 3.2 billion pounds ($4.01 billion), exceeding pre-pandemic levels, the company said. However, profit has yet to reach its pre-pandemic level of 26.9 pence per share. Read the sens here.
