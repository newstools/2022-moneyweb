South Africa’s office and retail property market is gaining a second wind after years of being unloved, according to Investec Property Fund. Half of the firm’s 77 new leases signed with clients in the year through March were in those sectors, creating an opportunity to dive back in after a period of disposals, joint-CEO Andrew Wooler said in an interview.

Investec Property Fund may dispose of its 65% stake in a pan-European logistics portfolio as rising property values and falling rental yields create an exit opportunity. “There’s opportunity to exit and crystallize significant value for shareholders and then recycle that capital,” Wooler said.
