Eskom has suspended load shedding, effective 12:00 on Saturday, after the power system recovered sufficiently, with emergency reserves “adequately replenished”. Initially the country had been advised that stage 2 load shedding would persist from May 3 until 05:00 on Monday, “owing to delays in returning generators to service, as well as breakdowns of nine generators.” “Generation units at Matla, Majuba, Grootvlei and Kendal power stations as well as the non-commercial Kusile unit have returned to service this morning,” its statement released on Saturday reads. There is 3 872MW on planned maintenance, and another 13 326MW of capacity unavailable due to breakdowns. It expects another unit each at Matimba and Arnot power stations to return to service later on Saturday. The embattled power utility did however warn consumers to use electricity sparingly, as the onset of winter has seen increased demand and a constrained system is expected throughout the season.
