Prosus, the Dutch-based technology investor, said on Friday it would seek a buyer for its Russian online marketplace Avito. Avito had been one of Prosus’s most valuable investments until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, which Moscow describes as a “special military operation”, with an estimated valuation of about $6 billion.

In March, Prosus said it would cut ties with Avito and would not seek to benefit economically from its ownership.

That decision was criticised after it emerged that Avito had carried advertisements for Russian military jobs. Prosus then said it would separate Avito from its online marketplace businesses, part of the larger OLX Group, but had not clarified what would happen after the separation. Prosus is controlled by Naspers of South Africa. Its shares have fallen by more than 40% over the past year, largely tracking the value of its biggest asset, a 28.9% stake in Chinese online media giant Tencent 0700.
