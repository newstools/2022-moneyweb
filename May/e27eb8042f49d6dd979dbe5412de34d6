Power utility Eskom will implement stage 2 load shedding from 17h00 to 22h00 on Monday evening (3o May) after a generation unit each at Majuba and Medupi power stations broke down earlier in the day. However, Eskom says it expects three other generation units which are currently offline, to return to service by Monday evening.

We appeal to all South Africans to help limit the impact of the shortages by continuing to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items,” the utility said in its latest load shedding warning. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks.” The power utility says it currently has 2 246 megawatts of generation capacity unavailable due to planned maintenance while a further 15 847MW of capacity is currently lost due to breakdowns. “We would like to remind the public that load shedding is implemented only as a last resort to protect the national grid. “We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly, especially between 05h00 – 09h00 in the mornings and 16h00 – 22h00 in the evenings.”
