The Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) and the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) have signed a new mandate related to unlisted developmental investments in Africa. The PIC confirmed the new mandate in a short statement on Tuesday, but did not reveal the value of the deal. However, Bloomberg reported that the agreement is worth around $1.6 billion (just over R25 billion). If this figure is correct, then it is much lower than the GEPF’s previous unlisted developmental investment mandate with the PIC, which was valued at around R70 billion. Tuesday’s confirmation from the PIC comes after its previous mandate with the GEPF lapsed more than a year ago, with negotiations around the new mandate taking place since March last year.

Investments per entity “The target of developmental investments for South Africa is between R300 million and R500 million per entity, although attractive investments starting at R100 million will be considered per entity,” it says. “The rest of Africa developmental investment portfolio shall mainly comprise of investments between $20 million and $40 million.” The GEPF, which is Africa’s largest pension fund, first introduced the unlisted developmental investment mandate in 1997 under the name Isibaya Fund. It has renewed this mandate with the PIC over the years.
