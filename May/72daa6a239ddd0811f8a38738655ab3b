The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) has announced that from Wednesday consumers can expect the price of a litre of petrol – both 93 and 95 – to be 12 cents cheaper and that of diesel to be 92 cents (0.005% sulphur) and 98 cents (0.05%) more expensive. Further, consumers can expect the wholesale price of paraffin to increase by 79.60 cents per litre, with its retail price to cost R1.49 more this month. The latest fuel price adjustments were informed by various factors including the price of crude oil, international petroleum product prices and the rand/US dollar exchange rate. “The main contributing factor to high crude oil prices is the concern caused by continued Russia/Ukraine conflict, as Russia is one of the biggest global exporters of oil,” the DMRE says in a statement released on Tuesday. “The average international product prices of petrol decreased, while diesel and IP (illuminating paraffin) increased due to a shortage of middle distillates in the market. Remember that the sanctions against Russia mean that diesel from Russia will not go into the international market so there is still a shortage there,” director of fuel price mechanism at the DMRE Robert Maake adds.
