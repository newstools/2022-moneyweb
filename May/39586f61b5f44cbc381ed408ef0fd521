In the first quarter, job gains were recorded mainly in the community and social services sector, followed by manufacturing. The trade sector also had job gains. Despite the dip in the headline unemployment rate, it remained near record highs as other key sectors like finance, construction and agriculture recorded job losses in the quarter.
