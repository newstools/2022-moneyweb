Eskom has announced that Stage 2 load shedding will be in force from 17:00 until 22:00 on Friday night, due to the “continued shortage of generation capacity during the evening peak”. Capacity constraints has seen the utility implement Stage 2 load shedding every day this week. Several generating units are expected to return to service starting Friday afternoon and through the weekend. Although generating units had been returned to service at several power stations, Eskom said capacity was insufficient as a generation unit each at the Kriel, Kusile, Majuba, Camden, Matla power stations “either tripped or were taken offload for repairs.” The utility said 2 094MW is on planned maintenance, with another 16 305MW of capacity unavailable due to breakdowns.
