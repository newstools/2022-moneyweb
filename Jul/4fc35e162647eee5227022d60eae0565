The South African city of Cape Town is starting a programme to buy power from commercial and industrial producers who will be allowed to send power to the grid for cash, Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said. Private electricity producers must register with the city to qualify for the programme, Hill-Lewis told reporters Monday. The city plans to roll out a programme to residential producers once a commercial program has been established, he said. © 2022 Bloomberg
