Twitter Inc.’s case against Elon Musk over a failed $44 billion takeover will go to trial October 17-21, a Delaware judge ruled. The date comes after Musk’s lawyers said earlier this week that Twitter was seeking an October 10 start date “without justification.” Twitter told the court it wasn’t opposed to an October 17 start, but wanted the full five-day trial that week. Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick issued the July 28 order setting the date.
