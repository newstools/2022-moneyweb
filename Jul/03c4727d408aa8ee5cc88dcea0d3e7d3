Its objective is to transform the demographics of the accounting profession to reflect those of the country in terms of race and gender and provide educational support to African learners and students for the benefit of the profession, while simultaneously helping to uplift communities. MoneywebNOW’s Simon Brown chats with Robert Zwane, Saica Executive: Learning, Development and National Imperatives about this initiative in more detail in this video.
