Key South African government websites have gone offline for at least the second time this year. Attempts to access sites including those of the South African presidency, the National Treasury and the Department of Mineral & Energy Resources on Tuesday afternoon returned messages saying the requested URL could not be retrieved. State Information Technology Agency spokesman Tlali Tlali said he wasn’t immediately able to comment when sent questions by text message.
