According to a survey run by Budget Insurance with over 2 000 South Africans, while the amount of money being saved is not substantial due to the cost of living crisis, 47% of those who can save, do so for ‘rainy days’. The pandemic taught us that rainy days are possible, and that they are hard and taxing on our monthly budgets.  South Africans know this, and are putting aside whatever funds they can to cushion unexpected blows. Those who are not able to save money blame the rapid rise in the cost of essentials (40%), unplanned emergencies (13%) and family obligations (12%). What’s clear is that saving money is not necessarily dependent on income but rather, on resolve and discipline. The survey respondents shared some hacks to help other South Africans make saving money, possible: Remember that even the smallest adjustments in a number of areas of your budget can add up to significant savings. The small changes and sacrifices you make now will be worth it in the long-run. Susan Steward is at Budget Insurance.
