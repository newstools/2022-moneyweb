The head of South Africa’s National Treasury said he is “pretty confident” the country will have addressed regulatory weaknesses in its money laundering controls by year-end, a move that should help avert its inclusion on a global watchdog’s list of nations that are subjected to greater oversight due to their shortcomings in tackling illicit finance. Africa’s most industrialised economy was found wanting in all 11 of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force’s effectiveness measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, Ismail Momoniat, the National Treasury’s acting director general said in an interview on SAfm radio on Tuesday.

While it will take about three years to effect all necessary changes, the country must “demonstrate that we’ve got a credible action plan, that we’ve taken meaningful steps already by February,” to avert being added to the watchdog’s so-called gray list, he said. The central bank has previously warned the classification could have wide-reaching consequences for South Africa’s financial system.  Besides causing it reputational damage, it could lead to capital and currency outflows, and transactional, administrative and funding costs for banks could increase, it said.
