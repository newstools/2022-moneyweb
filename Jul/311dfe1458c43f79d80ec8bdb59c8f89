South Africa plans to try and resolve its chronic power shortage by making it easier for private companies to build plants and paying households and businesses to produce electricity from solar panels. The urgent need to fix the country’s 14-year electricity crisis has been laid bare by five weeks of power outages that ended last week, the worst since the near-collapse of the grid in 2008. President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress have been heavily criticised over their inability to resolve the problem, despite repeated promises to do so.

That’s met an ideological backlash from powerful interests within the ANC that want greater state control of the industry. Ramaphosa has said he will publicly announce a plan to tackle the crisis in coming days. Calls to his spokesman Vincent Magwenya weren’t immediately answered.

The company can reliably produce about 26,000 megawatts at present, against a winter peak of 32 000 megawatts. The presidency’s plans would add 7 165 megawatts of capacity within three months, a further 5 663 megawatts in a year and 9 770 megawatts in 18 months, meaning that the amount of available generation capacity could almost double.

Those gains would come from Eskom units returned from outages, demand management, new generation capacity, private investment, power from solar panels on rooftops and the completion of the Medupi and Kusile coal-fired power plants. Beyond 18 months, there is scope to see a further 8 700 megawatts of new generation capacity procured, the presidency said. The need for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and “credible, confidence-boosting measures” is also part of the plan, to “assure South Africans that significant actions are being taken to address the crisis.” The main points are as follows: “Cabinet has decided to establish a National Energy Crisis Committee, which will involve all relevant ministers, departments and agencies, with a technical team chaired by the director general in the presidency,” the plan said.
