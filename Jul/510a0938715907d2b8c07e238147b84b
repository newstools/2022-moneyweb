The rand advanced early on Monday, as the safe-haven dollar nudged down from multi-year highs. At 0731 GMT, the rand traded at R17.00 against the dollar, 0.34% stronger than its previous close. The US dollar index, which measures the buck against six major peers, dropped 0.39% to 107.45. Economists at ETM Analytics said in a note that the rand’s value against the dollar would continue to consolidate around the R17.00 level until a new catalyst arises. On the stock market, the Top-40 index and the broader all-share index rose more than 2% in early trade. The government’s benchmark 2030 bond was flat in early deals, with the yield at 10.965%.
