My partner and I want to invest in the property market. We currently rent an apartment. In the medium term, our goal is to own our primary residence and have a few investment properties. We want to have the primary residence in one name and the investment properties in the other name so that we can get more access to bond finance. The question is, what should we aim to acquire first? Do we put our cash together for deposit/transfer fees to buy a primary residence or do we buy investment properties, wait a few years then leverage them for a deposit on our primary residence?  The question of whether to first buy a primary residence or investment property is extremely subjective and depends on a lot of factors and variables. The first question you should ask yourself is why you want to own investment properties specifically, compared to investing in the stock market. Buying an investment property is very much putting all your eggs in one basket, especially if it makes up a large chunk of your overall wealth. I am going to approach this question by mentioning the pros and cons of owning a primary residence versus owning an investment property: Primary residence Pros: Cons: Investment property Pros: Cons: The pros and cons listed above are only a few factors that you need to consider when making this decision and, from the above, you will see that it is very much a subjective decision. The most important factor is to decide what your long-term objectives are and whether buying a primary residence or investment property supports these objectives. Ideally, we suggest that you consult with an independent financial advisor who can guide you through the decision-making process.
