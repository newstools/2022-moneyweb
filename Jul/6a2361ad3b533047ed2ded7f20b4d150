Owning a house or investing in property is still perceived as being out of reach for many South Africans. Barriers to entry such as the affordability factor and lack of access to credit may turn people off. In this video, Rupert Finnemore CEO of EasyProperties, speaks to Moneyweb deputy editor Suren Naidoo about an alternative way of investing in property which broadens access and breaks down barriers to enter the market. This discussion took place at the Better Investor Conference in June 2022. Watch more sessions here. Brought to you by EasyProperties.
