The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) insists that suspended Director-General Kgathatso Tlhakudi was involved in the selection process of a strategic equity partner (SEP) for South African Airways (SAA). This follows reports that Tlhakudi was not involved in the SEP process. “The Director-General was involved in the process. Only the sale and purchase agreement was signed by the acting DG on 22 February 2022 as the DG was on sick leave, but he was privy to the sale and purchase agreement and its contents or terms and conditions,” the department said in a statement on Monday, condemning “deliberate misinformation” around the transaction. Explaining the process to of acquiring SEPs for SAA, the DPE says: The DPE says the DG was intimately involved in the process, engaging potential SEPs when the NDA was signed and communicating the outcome of the expression interest to the parties. Further, Tlhakudi had signed Harith General Partners’ letter of acceptance as the preferred bidder for SAA. “The DG was actively involved in engaging with local and international parties wishing to invest in SAA. He was intimately involved in the SAA transaction and further engaged with the media in the process.“ The department says it is seeking legal advice on action to be taken on the leaking of official information and subsequent misinformation relating to the process, adding that fact distortion “negatively impacts and compromise the process.” Tlhakudi was reportedly suspended pending the completion of a disciplinary process, after a complaint was laid against him at the Public Service Commission.
