MyBroadband says the average mobile download speed in South Africa is 49.92Mbps while the average upload speed is 14.84Mbps. The report’s network quality score, which ranks mobile network companies according to download and upload speed, and latency, placed MTN first with a 9.75 score out of 10, Vodacom followed at 6.38, Telkom at 4.96, Cell C at 4.29 and Rain at 3.87. “MTN’s exceptional performance results from a R50 billion network investment over the past five years, helping it to extend coverage, improve network quality, and increase speeds,” notes the report. In the prior comparative period, MTN placed first with the highest average download speed of 67.22Mbps and a network quality score of 9.79. MyBroadband says the average download speed in South Africa increased by 12Mbps, in the second quarter, due to the increased availability of 4G and 5G access in South Africa.
