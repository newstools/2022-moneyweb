Searcher Seismic Ltd. is planning a survey looking for oil offshore South Africa, months after it called off an earlier search due to a court challenge. The company is applying for authorisation to carry out the activity in multiple oil and gas blocks and ultra-deep water off the country’s west coast, according to its assessment practitioner, Environmental Impact Management Services. The survey is planned to take place as close as 218 kilometers (135 miles) offshore South Africa, a background document showed. Searcher in March said it would leave work incomplete in another area closer to the coast after South Africa’s High Court ordered it to discontinue the activity. Environmental organisations and communities have stepped up opposition to oil and gas exploration, filing lawsuits to stop seismic surveys, which they say are harmful to marine life. They have also criticised the process used to consult people who could be affected by the work. A smaller survey area has been selected this time and the community is being consulted to gauge any concerns, Al Hopping, general manager for Searcher, said in an emailed response to questions. “We have taken onboard the learnings from our last attempt and are planning to address all the issues,” he said. Communities in December won a case against Shell Plc, which temporarily blocked seismic activity off another part of the South African coast. © 2022 Bloomberg
