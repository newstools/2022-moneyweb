Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA), through a Request for Information (RFI) process, is calling on the private sector to submit project proposals for its new Renewable Energy Programme to supply green power at eight of SA’s main commercial seaports. The programme intends to procure between 50MW and 80MW of renewable energy.

Spiralling fuel prices a threat to TNPA’s liquid bulk volume targets TNPA anticipates that the responses to the RFI will aid its understanding of the renewable energy market, specifically for wind and solar, while considering the use of other sources including hybrids of hydroelectric power, ocean energy, biomass and geothermal energy. The ports authority says it may release a Request for Proposals (RFP) provided that sufficient information is gathered from RFI submissions. Nondumiso Lehutso is a Moneyweb intern.
