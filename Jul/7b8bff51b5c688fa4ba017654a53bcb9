The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has conducted a search and seizure operation at the property of financial services company, Akani Retirement Fund Administrators. The authority indicated in a statement issued on Thursday, that the order, carried out in line with the Financial Sector Regulation (FSR) Act of 2017, was granted by the Deputy Judge President of the Gauteng Division (Pretoria) of the High Court, Opulent Molopa. “The purpose of the operation was to gather facts and information to assist the authority in its current investigation into the entity, after the FSCA received complaints which contained sufficient information to create a reasonable suspicion that financial sector laws may have been contravened by Akani,” says the financial watchdog.
