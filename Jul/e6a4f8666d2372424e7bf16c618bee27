Eskom, South Africa’s state electricity utility, has submitted its so-called safety case application to keep Africa’s sole nuclear power plant open, the National Nuclear Regulator said. Eskom wants to extend the life of the 1 800 megawatt Koeberg power plant near Cape Town by another 20 years from 2024. The NNR, which commented in a statement on Wednesday, said the application had been made within prescribed timelines.
