Transnet’s subsidiary and primary operator of South Africa’s fuel pipeline system, Transnet Pipelines (TPL), is looking for a partner to develop liquified natural gas (LNG) import facilities at its Richards Bay Port. TPL on Friday announced its participation in the planned Section 56 process for request for proposals (RFP) issued by Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA). This comes after the ports authority issued the RFP on July 27. “TNPA seeks a terminal operator to design, develop, construct, finance, operate, maintain and transfer a liquified natural gas terminal in the port of Richards Bay.” The pipeline operator, which is the largest multi-product pipeline operator in Southern Africa, is searching for qualifying partners to enter into a joint development agreement (JDA) that will enable the parties to collaborate on the response to the ports authority’s RFP. “The responses will be scored based on, amongst other criteria, the financial capacity, LNG project development experience, experience with LNG or infrastructure project financing, expertise in negotiating LNG or natural gas related agreements, and technical experience.” TPL’s core strategic mandate is to ensure petroleum security of supply for the inland market and gas security of supply for the KwaZulu-Natal market. “It is strategically positioned to enable regional pipelines integration from source pipelines to other modes of transport,” it adds. The RFP, which is set to close on August 19, can be found on the National Treasury’s e-Tenders portal and Transnet’s website. Nondumiso Lehutso is a Moneyweb intern.
