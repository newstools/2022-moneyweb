President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a mix of business professionals, veterans and academics to serve on the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council, which will be tasked with assisting government with its economic transformation agenda. The council, which will consist of 14 members, is formed in line with Section 6(1) (d) of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (Act No 53 of 2003). Some of the notable appointments to the council include Competition Commission chief economist, James Hodge, as well as the Black Business Council’s CEO Kganki Matabane. The council appointees will serve for a period of five years. “Provincial representation, sector expertise, gender and age are among the considerations that informed the composition of the Council,” the Presidency says in a statement issued on Wednesday. “In line with the legislation that applies to the council, members are drawn from business, trade unions, community-based organisations and academia. They also have broad expertise in major sectors of the economy.” Other members of the council include: “President Ramaphosa thanks the new members of the council for availing themselves to serve the country in this capacity and he wishes the council the best in advancing black economic empowerment as part of the comprehensive transformation of the South African economy,” the statement adds.
