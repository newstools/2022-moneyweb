TFG – the JSE-listed vertically integrated clothing, homeware and furniture retailer – has staged a strong ‘post Covid’ recovery, with full-year revenue hitting a record R46.2 billion for its year ended 31 March 2022. The group’s latest results, published on Friday, shows that revenue for the year surged almost 30% from the Covid-hit 2021 financial year, while group retail turnover shot up 31.6% to R43.4 billion. This is despite the impact of the riots in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Gauteng in July last year, which saw almost 200 of its stores being looted and damaged. Headline earnings per share (Heps) came in at 1 009 cents, up 409.9%, compared to 197.9 cents per share for its prior financial year. Group operating profit before finance costs came in at R4.8 billion (vs loss of R719.2 million for FY21). Dividends TFG has returned to paying a full-year dividend on the back of the strong performance, declaring a final dividend of 330 cents per share. It paid out an interim dividend of 170 cents for its half-year, while no dividend was declared in the 2021 financial year. TFG says the strong performance also came with market share gains and increased profitability. “The group delivered a robust post-Covid-19 recovery during the past financial year… Retail outlets delivered a strong trading performance as economic activity resumed in the wake of reduced restrictions on movement and travel,” it notes in a Sens results statement.
