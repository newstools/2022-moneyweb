The fashion industry’s 30 largest listed companies risk falling short of social and environmental targets of the Paris climate agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals, despite incremental improvement from some sector leaders, a new report from the Business of Fashion has shown. It analyses progress on environmental and social targets, including workers’ rights. Sports brand Puma scored best, but still only got 49 points out of 100. Gucci-owner Kering came second, with Levi Strauss third. Sarah Kent, The Business of Fashion chief sustainability correspondent, says: “Fundamentally the big picture is that the industry is wildly underperforming.” The survey covered the industry’s 30 largest listed firms. Companies scored the highest for reducing emissions, and did the worst at reducing waste. The report says firms must find a way to drive financial growth, without just making more (products).
