South Africa recorded foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows of R27.2 billion ($1.7 billion) in the first quarter of 2022, up from R22.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, the central bank said on Tuesday. The South African Reserve Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin that the increase was due to foreign entities increasing equity investments and granting loans to domestic subsidiaries. Portfolio investment reverted to inflows of R64.2 billion in the first quarter, following revised outflows of R40.0 billion in the previous quarter as non-residents acquired equity and debt securities, it said.
