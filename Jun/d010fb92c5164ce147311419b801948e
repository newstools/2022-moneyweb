Clothing retailer Edgars has announced its new nationwide Click & Collect online shopping option, in partnership with logistics company Pargo. In addition, Edgars will be adding about 100 of its stores to a network of over 3 000 Pargo pickup points in the country. The retailer, which was acquired by the Retailability Group in 2020, says the inclusion will make Pargo the largest pickup point network in South Africa. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Edgars confirmed that customers will be able to order their items online and collect them at a nearby pickup point. “They can collect when it suits them without rearranging their day or rescheduling couriers as they would with traditional delivery services,” it adds. The retailer says that the online shopping offer is also available to customers living in outlying areas that are difficult to reach, including rural and informal settlements, enabling them to shop online without worrying about not qualifying for a delivery or missing their parcels. “Though ecommerce is growing exponentially in South Africa, delivery can still be tricky for many, especially for those living in regional or outlying areas,” says Richard Mclennan, head of ecommerce at Retailability. “It is our aim to deliver on the convenience of online shopping by giving everyone an opportunity to easily get their order no matter where they are in the country. That is why a partnership with Pargo makes so much sense,” he adds. Retailability says the move is one of several key commitments made by the group to bring more quality brands to every South African customer. Nondumiso Lehutso is a Moneyweb intern.
