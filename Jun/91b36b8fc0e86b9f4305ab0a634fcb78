Eskom has ramped up its power cut cycle, with stage 2 load shedding set to start from 10:00 on Wednesday until midnight. Recently load shedding has been implemented only during evening peaks. The latest spate of load shedding – which was supposed to end on Thursday – will now continue until Sunday evening Eskom says. The power utility also added that starting from Thursday, load shedding will begin at 5:00 am. Eskom has further warned consumers of the possibility that the current stage of load shedding may be intensified during the evening peaks, where demand for electricity is at its highest. “A generation unit each at the Kendal and Matimba [power stations], as well as two units at the Matla Power Station broke down this morning. This reduced generation capacity by 2 400MW, adding to the ongoing capacity constraints,” Eskom says in a statement. “There has been a delay in returning to service a unit at Kusile Power Station, which is now expected to return to service tomorrow.” Read: SA transmission firm seen hobbled by Eskom millstone The utility currently has 3 630 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity out on planned maintenance, with a further 15 277MW of capacity out of service due to breakdowns. “Eskom cautions the public that as the shortage of generation capacity persists, the system will continue to be constrained with an elevated risk of load shedding over the coming weeks.” The struggling power utility asks consumers to use electricity sparingly especially during morning peak times of 05:00 – 10:00 and evening peaks of 16:00 – 22:00.
