Power utility Eskom has announced that stage two load shedding will return from Monday evening between 17:00 to 22:00, continuing until Thursday evening. In a statement issued on Monday, the utility blamed the latest round of blackouts on a shortage of generation capacity. “We currently have 5 232 megawatts (MW) on planned maintenance, while another 14 202MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns,” Eskom said. The utility further cautioned power users to use electricity sparingly as it anticipates that generation struggles will persist over the coming weeks and an elevated risk of load shedding. According to load shedding app EskomSePush, South Africa has experienced 28 days of load shedding in 2022 alone. Read:
