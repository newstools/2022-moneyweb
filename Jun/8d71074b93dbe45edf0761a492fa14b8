 Quadrimune comes in the form of sweet-tasting granules that can be sprinkled on soft food or dissolved in mill or water, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority said in a statement on Friday. The treatment combines four antiretroviral treatments. Dolutegravir tablets, made by Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd., for the treatment of children with HIV, were also registered for use. About 13% of South Africa’s population, or 8.2 million people, are infected with HIV, according to the national statistics agency.
