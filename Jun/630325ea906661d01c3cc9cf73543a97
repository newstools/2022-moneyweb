The South African rand strengthened on Tuesday, as the dollar consolidated gains near a two-decade peak amid fears that aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve would push the U.S. economy into recession. At 17:59, the rand traded at 16.0525 against the dollar, 0.48% stronger than its previous close. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major peers, was up around 0.2% at 105.39. BNP Paribas senior economist Jeff Schultz said in a note that the South African Reserve Bank was expected to maintain a 50 basis points pace of hikes for its three remaining meetings in 2022, followed by a final 25 bp hike in January 2023. “We also would not rule out a 75 bp hike in either July or September in the event of more acute ZAR weakness,” Schultz added. On the stock market, local indexes lost over 1% as investors continued to worry about an aggressive rate hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The broader all-share index slipped to an eight-month low. Read:
