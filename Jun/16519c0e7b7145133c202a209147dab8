South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will appear before the ruling African National Congress’s integrity commission after charges were laid against him in connection with a robbery at his game farm. The former head of the State Security Agency, Arthur Fraser, last week alleged that Ramaphosa concealed the theft of more than $4 million from his farm in the northern Limpopo province in February 2020 and that the suspects were illegally detained and interrogated. Ramaphosa has denied any wrongdoing. The party “commended the decision by the President to voluntarily present himself to the ANC Integrity Commission in line with ANC policy,” national spokesman, Pule Mabe, said in an emailed statement.
