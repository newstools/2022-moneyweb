These taxpayers will receive a notification from Sars that states that they have a pre-populated income tax return available to review, on eFiling or the Sars MobiApp. If you accept your auto-assessment, any under or overpayment of tax will be processed as normal. If you want to edit your return, you can do so, on e-Filing or the Sars MobiApp. Before accepting the auto-assessment, the taxpayer must ensure to review the preloaded information to confirm the accuracy of this data.

An individual who does not agree with the estimated assessment can file an accurate ITR12 tax return within 40 business days of the date of the estimated assessment. If you proceed with editing the preloaded tax return, and Sars is not satisfied, Sars may select your return for review and verification. Should you owe Sars money, you can make a payment on eFiling, via EFT or the Sars MobiApp by the specified due date as per your Notice of Assessment.
