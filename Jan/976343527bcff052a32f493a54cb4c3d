Most global finance firms are planning to establish or expand operations in the UK in 2022, according to a survey of 40 key decision-makers in the industry. Around 87% of global financial services investors expect to invest in the UK next year, EY’s latest poll found. That’s the highest since the professional services firm started tracking sentiment toward the country in 2016, the year of the Brexit vote, and compares to 50% in early 2021 and a low of 11% in 2019. The data is a boost for the City of London, whose credentials as an international finance center are being questioned since the UK left the European Union. Meanwhile, 90% of respondents said the UK offers the right conditions to invest in assets with environmental, social and governance attributes. “This is testament to the stability and resilience of the mature UK market which continues to ably withstand the material challenges and uncertainty of both the pandemic and Brexit,” said Anna Anthony, EY’s financial services managing partner for the UK.
