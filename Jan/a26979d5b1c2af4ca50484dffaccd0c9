The JSE had an exceptional 12 months, with a total return of 29% – its best performance in more than a decade. And the momentum has continued into 2022. However, this optimism seems to ignore a few dark clouds. In the US, inflation is rising, and interest rates will follow suit. The US is also taking the cheap money that has supported equity markets around the world for several years off the table. These are all events that should, in theory at least, put pressure on equity valuations. Unfortunately, the recent performances of many markets do not suggest that much attention is paid to traditional valuation principles. Sign up here.
