Alexander Forbes has appointed Ann Leepile as chief executive officer of the group’s investments division, effective February 1, 2022. The chartered financial analyst charter holder has 20 years of experience in the investment industry and has attended the Executive Women in Leadership Programme of the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Leepile is ideally placed to lead the next phase of growth for Alexander Forbes Investments given her deep technical expertise, understanding of the market and leadership track record,” the company said in a statement. “She will join the Alexander Forbes Group executive committee to ensure that investments continue to play a key role in the execution of the group’s strategy.” Leepile has also previously served as the head of global manager research and ultimately deputy chief investment officer of Alexander Forbes Investments (formerly Investment Solutions), which the group says gives her direct insight into the dynamics of the business and its clients. Dawie de Villiers, CEO of Alexander Forbes said: “Ann’s appointment sharpens our focus to deliver upon the immense potential that now exists within Alexander Forbes Investments to grow exponentially into the future as we leverage our transformative investment capabilities, institutional scale and market-leading membership base. “This is an exciting phase for Alexander Forbes Investments, and I look forward to the impact that the business will continue to make on the lives of our clients.” The group noted that Leepile joins Alexander Forbes after heading Absa Asset Management for six years during which she grew the business to one of the largest asset managers in SA.
