MTN Group’s biggest operation, MTN Nigeria Communications, has turned in a strong set of financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, with margin improvement across the board and a spike in profits. Operational margins – calculated using earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) – climbed by 2.1 percentage points to 53%. Profit after tax and earnings per share jumped by 45.5% each to ₦298.7 billion (R11.2 billion) and ₦14.67 kobo respectively. The company hiked its full-year dividend by almost 40% to ₦8.57 kobo per share. The strong numbers, which sent MTN Group’s shares in Johannesburg to a near-seven-year high on Monday morning above R188/share, came despite a 10.6% decline in the Nigerian company’s mobile subscriber base – impacted by regulatory restrictions on new Sim sales and activations. Service revenue grew by 23.3%, exceeding the group’s mid-teens target, driven mainly by voice, data and fintech services. MTN has now decided revised the medium-term target for service revenue growth to north of 20%, suggesting there’s momentum behind the latest performance.
