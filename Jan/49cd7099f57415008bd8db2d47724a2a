A 4 000 sqm mansion house in Houghton Ridge is on sale for R65 million, at a 45% discount from the original price. The Gatsby as it is called, boasts eight ensuite bedrooms, six parking spaces, a luxurious private night club, wellness spa, library, gymnasium as well as conference facilities. The mansion also has a heated indoor swimming pool and an outdoor training pool. With four levels and large glass frontages, residents can enjoy panoramic views over the city. Its lavish furnishings and rare artworks are included in the sale. According to head of Gumtree property operations, Barrie Swart, this is not the first time a luxurious property such as this one has been listed. “There are several multi-million properties up for grabs at the moment. Covid-19 has impacted uber-wealthy homeowners as well – many are unable to travel to their luxury homes around the world during the current climate, and others are concerned about the volatility of the market,” he said. “It may not seem like it to us, but the Gatsby is a real bargain at this price and will definitely be swept up soon.” Palesa Mofokeng is a Moneyweb intern.
