South Africa has declared a national disaster after torrential rains in several parts of the country resulted in deaths, flooding and damage to property and infrastructure, according to a notice in the Government Gazette. Declaring a national disaster lays the basis for financial and humanitarian aid by the government. It is separate from the national state of disaster that’s been in place since March 2020 to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. © 2022 Bloomberg
