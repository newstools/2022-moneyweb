The South African rand opened sharply weaker on Thursday, as investors dumped riskier assets after Russian forces attacked the Ukraine. Investor sentiment was also dampened by Fitch Ratings pointing to difficulties containing spending and warning that recent strong revenue growth may prove temporary, in response to Wednesday’s 2022 budget. At 13:05, the rand traded at 15.2886 against the dollar, around 1.53% weaker than its closing level on Wednesday. The local bourse also took a knock, with the JSE All Share and the Top 40 down almost 2%. Global stocks dived, while the dollar, gold and oil prices rocketed higher. Gold had risen 3.37% to 1970.24 by lunch time, while the Brent crude price was a massive 8.18% higher, having passed the $100 mark earlier in the session, to reach over $105 per barrel. Read:
