Here is a breakdown of National Treasury’s 2022 Budget, in graphs. The fiscus is vastly improved from a year ago.  Government now expects a R351 billion shortfall for the 2022/23 financial year and a primary surplus to be achieved by 2023/24.  Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said the consolidated budget deficit is expected to narrow from 5.7% of GDP in 2021/22, to 4.2% by 2024/25.  Godongwana admitted that SA’s debt burden remains “a matter of serious concern.” Government debt reached R4.3 trillion this year and is seen rising to R5.4 trillion over the medium-term.  This debt burden incurs debt-service costs that average R330 billion annually over the MTEF.  Watch/read: Finance minister delivers the Budget 2022 speech
