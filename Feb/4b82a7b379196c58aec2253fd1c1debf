The National Bank of Rwanda unexpectedly increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time in almost a decade, with inflation threatening to go above target this year. The central bank expects inflation to average 7.5% this year from about 0.8% in 2021, partly due to an anticipated surge in the cost of food. The rate jumped to a 15-month high of 4.3% in January from 1.9% the previous month. Based on projections indicating that inflation “threatens to go above our upper band of 8% by the end of the year,” Rwangombwa said, “the MPC decided to increase the central bank rate.” Last week, Rwangombwa said in an interview that inflation was seen remaining within target despite an expected increase in food prices. He said then that the consumer price index would rise to around 5.4%. Rwanda’s central bank has made the biggest tightening move in sub-Saharan Africa so far this year. South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia have increased rates by 25 basis points.
