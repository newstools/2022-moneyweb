From April 1, 2022 the following increases apply: Pricing for Easyview, Showmax, Add Movies and BoxOffice remains unchanged. “At 2.7% the weighted adjustment across all of DStv’s offerings for 2022 is significantly lower than the projected CPI for the year,” it adds. It says the adjustments follow a period of increased value offerings in the form of local and international general entertainment and sports content, DStv Internet, and Rewards and that it has absorbed much of the increase of the cost of doing business in order to implement minimal adjustments.
