UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asked the Cabinet Office to look into allegations that global consultancy Bain & Co Inc was involved in corruption in South Africa, Johannesburg-based Daily Maverick reported, citing a letter Johnson sent to Peter Hain, a UK lawmaker. Read more on Bain here. Hain had asked that Johnson freeze all government contracts with Bain while South African prosecutors try to recoup money paid to the Boston-based company for a contract it had with the South African Revenue Service, according to Daily Maverick. Bain has denied wilfully facilitating or being party to corruption after a judicial inquiry in South Africa found its conduct wanting in their dealings with state-owned firms. A panel, headed by Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, found that Bain met with former President Jacob Zuma and former tax Commissioner Tom Moyane before it was signed up as a consultant, and it was clear it would be given a contract to revamp the tax agency’s systems prior to the start of the tender process. © 2022 Bloomberg
