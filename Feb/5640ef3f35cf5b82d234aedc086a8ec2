Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the South African government is committed to rebuilding Denel, the cash-strapped arms manufacturer that’s missed payments on its loans. The state-owned company had its bonds suspended by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Wednesday after delaying interest payments on two notes and capital redemption on one of them.

Government has reduced Denel’s debt to R290 million from R3 billion over the past two years, largely with the help of government funds used to pay off state-guaranteed loans, Gordhan said by phone from Pretoria. “Our next job is to rebuild Denel,” he said. “How this will be done in refloating Denel has still to be determined.” The nation’s debt-laden power utility Eskom is seeking to restructure its loans as it struggles to keep the lights on in Africa’s most-industrialised economy. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana is scheduled to deliver his first annual budget on February 23. A judicial panel investigating government corruption, referred to as state capture in South Africa, said on Tuesday it found that poor-quality appointments made to Denel’s board, including by Gordhan’s predecessor Lynne Brown, led to the company’s demise. The so-called Zondo Commission recommended some board members appointed in 2015 be further investigated for possible contravention of the Public Finance and Management Act.
