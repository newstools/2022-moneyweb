Sydney beaches, including the iconic Bondi Beach, were shut Thursday after the city’s first fatal shark attack in almost 60 years — just days before Australia reopens its borders to international tourists. Emergency services were called to Little Bay beach late Wednesday afternoon after reports a swimmer had been attacked by a shark. Police later said human remains were found in the water. A fisherman who witnessed the attack said the swimmer was taken by a great white shark about 4.5 meters (15 feet) long, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. It is the first deadly shark attack in Sydney since 1963, when actress Marcia Hathaway was killed by a bronze whaler shark in Middle Harbour, the Herald said. Randwick beaches including Little Bay, Malabar, Maroubra, Coogee, Clovelly and La Perouse will be closed for 24 hours following a fatal shark attack near Little Bay today. Council Lifeguards will patrol beaches over the next 24 hours looking for any further sightings of sharks. pic.twitter.com/0FFNwGCgwe — Randwick Council (@RandwickCouncil) February 16, 2022 The fatal attack comes just days before Australia reopens to international tourists on February 21, after almost two years of pandemic restrictions that saw the country largely cut off from the rest of the world. The nation’s sandy beaches, including Bondi, are often featured in advertising campaigns to lure tourists from the other side of the world. Beaches closed from Bondi south to La Perouse following yesterday’s tragic shark attack at Little Bay. Thoughts are with the grieving family and friends. pic.twitter.com/7omKK87JpQ — Dave Sharma (@DaveSharma) February 16, 2022
