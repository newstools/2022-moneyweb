South African retailer Steinhoff International has started a series of payouts to shareholders who lost money when its stock plunged after the revealing of accounting fraud in December 2017, it said on Tuesday. The implementation of its 1.43 billion euro ($1.62 billion) settlement offer will finally remove the single most significant overhang for the company, enabling it to focus on reducing debts and on the continued recovery from the fraud scandal. Shares of the company, majority owner of Pepkor in Africa and Pepco in Europe, closed 4.3% higher. The retailer had faced 90 separate legal claims in Germany, South Africa and the Netherlands, and to avoid lengthy and expensive multi-jurisdictional legal battles it had proposed the offer, which in September received approval from claimants and financial creditors, and recently courts.

It said pending legal proceedings, including a liquidation petition, will be withdrawn. The retailer said it had paid the settlement funds to a body called Stichting Steinhoff Recovery Foundation, set up to administer the distribution of funds to claimants after May 15.
