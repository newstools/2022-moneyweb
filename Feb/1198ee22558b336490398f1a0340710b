The Presidency officially received and publicly released the second part of the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector on Tuesday afternoon at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Part two of what is now colloquially referred to as the Zondo report is made up of two volumes – one on Transnet and the other on Denel. Access the volume on Transnet here.

It comes less than a month after President Cyril Ramaphosa received the first part of the report from acting Chief Justice and Commission chair Judge Raymond Zondo on January 4. The commission has until the end of February to submit its full report. “The handover of the second part of the report of the Commission of Inquiry is another significant step forward in the work we need to do to rid our country of corruption,” Ramaphosa said in a statement on Tuesday. “During the course of the past four years the Commission has constructed a disturbing picture of the depth and damage of state capture. “We should now apply our energies to the Commission’s recommendations and take the necessary steps to make sure we never face this onslaught on public resources and on the fabric of our society,” added Ramaphosa.
